# Why did I start learning about mental training?

- Bombing out at the same place 20km from takeoff in my first year of XC paragliding
- Irrational fears of flying over unlandable areas
- Loosing competition wins because of impatience
- It's the most fascinating rabbit hole of knowledge I've' ever found!

---

# 8 years of study … still ongoing

- Over 200 books on the topic
- 100s of hours of listening to relevant podcasts
- Dozens of online university lectures on psychology and cognitive science
- Talking with top pilots
- Self experimentation

---

# Why should you become your own mental trainer?

- You can’t afford one!
- Knowing why something works is much better than using checklists as you can creatively adapt technics to a specific problem
- It brings your non paragliding life forward, as well

# 10% Brain Usage

- Popular from movies like Lucy, Limitless, Phenomenon …

# Hallucinations are not a defect

- All you will ever see and hear and remember are hallucinations
- What you see at any given time depends on your past experiences and memories
- We only realize about these hallucinations being fake when we take drugs or if we dream

---

# 10’000 Hours Till Mastery

- Popularized by Malcom Gladwells book „Outliers“
- Better read the original from scientist Anders Ericsson: „Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise“
- Dependent on complexity of task
- 10’000 hours of deliberate (!!!) practice is just the start
- You will have a hard time reaching that many flying hours
- Use visualization to increase hours

---

# Not Like a Computer

- No „video feed"
- No lossless storage. We think with our memories!
- As much chemical as electrical
- Extremely parallel, not serial
- One brain has more "computing" power than all computers combined
- 3 to 7 pieces in memory, 200ms to 3 second temporal resolution
- Not really processing data, but processing change, even rewarding it

---

# Blank Slate

- Popularized by Steven Pinker
- Fixed basic structure
- Personality type is pretty much fixed
- Only two areas that create new neurons, mostly however in the hippocampus
- Change happens mostly by optimising or removing existing connections

---

# Not a Design, an Evolved Structure

- Reuse of old, existing structures
- Onion like structure (reptilien -> mammal -> human brain parts)
- The old parts are not primitive, they have evolved as well
- Adaptations from the past are not very well suited for todays lives or paragliding
- Some very energy inefficient constructs (20% of your energy consumption)

---

# Confabulation

- The subconscious brain makes most decisions
- Consciousness has very little access to that decision process (like a CEO of a huge company)
- A process called "confabulation“ (basically a creative storyteller) makes consciousness feel in control
- Vision, time, memory ... is not as you experience it!
- The confabulator creates logic, cause and effect, and we have no experience of that process

---

# Emotion Blueprints

- They don’t exist
- Emotions are constructed
- Everybody has different emotions
- You can change the meaning of emotions (framing)
- Being highly dopaminergic can make you a top pilot (and a bad family man)

---

# We are not rational beings!

- Dozens of known cognitive biases
- We all have them
- They fool you even if you know about them

![Cognitive biases](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg)

---

# Left and Right Sided Brains

- A big, fast superhighway is connecting both sides
- Many areas from different sides are better connected than areas of the same side
- The left side is always the dominant one as it contains the language center
- The right side has on average longer neurons, which makes it more creative, the left is more rational
- The brain is a story processor

---

# Talent is overrated

- Talent helps you reach a certain level faster
- Getting used to hard work makes it easier to overcome plateaus and finally reach higher levels
- Not everyone can be Chrigel Maurer, Roger Federer oder Usain Bolt
- You need to find motivation in being the best you

---

# The Amygdala

- There isn’t one fear center
- A whole system with multiple pathways
- Alex Honold has a normal Amygdala
- People without an Amygdala can experience fear
- Suppressing fear inducing experiences creates traumatic memories you can't track or solve anymore
- Transform highly memorable fearful experiences into learning experiences
- The fight or flight response is a misnomer, most people freeze (and fly straight into the tree)

---

# Mental model of the brain

---

# The Binding Problem

- Speed of sensory transmissions
- Speed of processing of information
- Should you feel your glider or look at your glider?
- You are never living in the present!
- Time is bundled into blocks of 200ms to 3 seconds

---

# Prediction Networks

- The brain is too slow for realtime processing like a computer
- A competition of predictions
- Feedback using latest sensory inputs and emotions declare the winner
- Consciousness is unaware of this process
- The confabulator makes sense of this predictions

---

# Fast vs. Slow

- Subconscious processes are fast, energy efficient and highly biased
- Conscious processes are slow and energy hungry
- Conscious processes are needed for strategic planning and statistical calculations
- Instincts are only useful if they are trained well

---

# Cognitive Biases

- Evolutionary adaptations
- Over 100 of them!
- Not well adapted to paragliding (or modern life)
- **A few key ones:**
- Loss aversion
- Dunning Kruger Effect
- Inattentional Blindness
- Contrast effect (for the brain everything is relative)

---

# Patternicity

- We see patterns everywhere, even where no patterns exist
- This creates bad data, noise
- Luck and randomness plays a bigger role than many think
- Correlation != causation

---

# Key Technics

---

# Fundament

- Health (food, excersize, avoid too much alcohol)
- Sleep (8 hours)
- Remove death from the equation
- In paragliding ignorance is not bliss!

---

# Flying Hours

- Nothing can replace big amounts of flying hours
- Ideally try to fly everyday for one month in a consistent area
- Again and again you can see pilots improving massively after vacations with tons of flying hours!

---

# Don’t get occupied by things you can’t change!

- There is always a risk in our sport … and walking over the road, showering … you get the point!
- You can’t change the weather, make the best out of it
- Condom broke? I made a 271 km flight after I pushed away the condom one hour after takeoff!
- Speedbar pulling rubber broke? I flew over 200 km with a bent knee while thermaling!
- Speedbar broke? I had the most amazing 45km glide from Dharamsala to Bir in the flats!

---

# Repetition

- Repetition makes the brain learn
- If something only happens once, your brain optimizes it away
- It may feel boring crossing the same valley a dozen times on the same day, but that is what training is.
- Don't blindly repeat tasks! Be highly focused, analyze and improve them!
- Repetition should not and doesn't have to be a chore!

---

# Be brutally honest to yourself!

- If you lie to yourself, you are just adding obstacles to your progression
- Worst case you create a trauma that is almost impossible to remove
- You’re creating bad data for your prediction networks if you lie to yourself!
- If you have a flying partner, be totally honest to him, as well

---

# Don’t remove sensory input!

- If you want to advance fast, get a wing that tells you what the air is doing.
- If you have a highly dampened wing, your brain has a hard time to get useful data.
- Fly with a helmet that lets you hear the wind
- While not flying, train your balance, it's a very useful sensor while flying

---

# WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan)

- A scientifically proven technic
- Think of something you really want that is challenging but doable
- Dream and visualize the outcome of that happening
- Identify all obstacles in the way of that dream
- Plan on how to overcome those obstacles
- This will be like a pull from the future

---

# The Skill Bubble

- Mental skills, body skills, knowledge …
- Each addition makes the bubble grow
- The bigger the bubble, the better you are protected, the better you can perform
- You have to revisit every skill or the bubble will shrink again

---

# Flow

- Optimal experience
- Optimal performance
- Fully focused on the task
- Happens close to your skills limits
- Improves speed of learning (can reduce the 10’000 hours)
- Create triggers to get out of flow when you have to make tactical decisions
- Occupying your conciousnes brain with something else (singing for example) can make you get into a flow state

---

# Tasks / Modes

- Split things into managable smaller tasks (thermaling, gliding, power soaring, dolphin flying …)
- Focus on what matters in a specific task
- Train each task separately
- Create triggers that make you switch tasks automatically (thermal gets slower etc.)

---

# Training vs. Flying

- 80% training, 20% flying for results
- Training is conscious, focused and using repetition
- ...
- Train thermaling
- Train valley crossings
- Train gliding on speedbar (with enough altitude)
- Train spotting birds thermaling, or trees shaking, or clouds growing
- ...
- Retrain skills to overcome plateaus, you never stop learning!

---

# Framing

- Framing changes the emotional content of your prediction networks
- Dance with turbulent thermals
- Altitude is your friend, is security, makes you glide further …
- Glider movement helps you understand the air
- The unknown creates prediction errors which is rewarded by a dopamine rush
- Getting cold means unstable and strong thermals. The best days are when you freeze high up and sweat low down
- Framing is basically nothing else than using confabulation to your advantage

---

# Priming

- Priming changes which prediction networks are used right now
- Say „thermal“ out loud to find thermals easier
- Plan for 150 km if you want to fly 100 km
- Do the Skyman pose on takeoff
- A turbulent day makes you better at tolerating turbulence (accustomation effect)

---

# Flying Route as a Memory Palace

- Works with routes you fly often
- Put creative things on top of mountains
- Makes it easier to remember hard to remember stuff like numbers and helps with prepared decisions

---

# The Default Network

- If you don’t focus on something specific, the brain tends to switch back to the default network
- It’s our social network
- Use it to your advantage (impressing friends can motivate)
- Surround yourself with positive, progressive, analytical people

---

# Obstacles & Stoicism

- Obstacles force learning
- Obstacles are something good
- Welcome them!
- Read about stoicism and become a fan of this old art

---

# Further Learning

- Warning: Learning about this stuff is the biggest Dunning Kruger Effect possible
- The importance of sleep and being brutally honest to yourself
- Ask me (Birdness Facebook page)
